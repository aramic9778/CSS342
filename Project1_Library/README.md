# Library

Implements a Library class.

Introduces the following concepts:

- using shell scripts to fully test programs
- command line parameters
- reading strings, integers and whole lines from file using ifstream, good, ignore, getline
- using operator<< to print objects
- const variables
- const functions
- const reference parameters
- const reference return values
- functions with undefined behavior
- using clang-tidy, clang-format and code coverage tools
- g++ flags and valgrind to check for memory leaks

I DIDN'T KNOW WHY IN TESTS AFTER PUSH_BACK AND POP_BACK "DUMMY" PRESENTED IN SOME LINES, THATS WHY WHEN I RETURN ERROR(WHICH = "DUMMY").
I KNOW THAT I NEEDED TO RETURN ANOTHER VARIABLE BUT I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
